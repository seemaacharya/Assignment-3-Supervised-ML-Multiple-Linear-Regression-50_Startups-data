# Assignment-3-Supervised-ML-Multiple-Linear-Regression-50_Startups-data

Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data.
Do transformations for getting better predictions of profit and
make a table containing R^2 value for each prepared model.

R&D Spend -- Research and devolop spend in the past few years
Administration -- spend on administration in the past few years
Marketing Spend -- spend on Marketing in the past few years
State -- states from which data is collected
Profit  -- profit of each state in the past few years
